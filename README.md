A simple python script that converts a .pages document into a PDF. GUI version, command-line version, and executables coming soon! (hopefully)

The Scripts
===========
pages-pdf is the working console version, authored by me be refactored and overhauled by [StackOverflow user Martineau]()(see below)

Attributions/Acknowledgements
=============================
If not for the help of StackOverflow users [Martineau](), [](), [J.F. Sebastian](http://stackoverflow.com/users/4279/j-f-sebastian) [](), I probably would not have the program running right now.
You can see the individual questions where they completely overhauled my code until it was barely recognizable as mine [here](), [here](), and [here]().
