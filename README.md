pages-pdf
=========

A simple python script that converts a .pages document into a PDF. ~~GUI version~~, command-line version, and executables coming soon! (hopefully)

The scripts _should_ be cross-platform but they have only been tested on Windows.

The Scripts
===========
* pages-pdf.py is the working console version.
* pages-pdf-gui.py is the working GUI version. To make it run without a console in Windows.
* pages-pdf.py is the old script, that I wrote all on my lonesome before going to SO for help (it turns out that that the `ZipFile` module I was trying to use didn't have the functionality I needed). It is here for historical/legacy purposes, and to prove how much I needed the help I got from SO.

Attributions/Acknowledgements
=============================
If not for the help of StackOverflow users [Martineau](), [Ruben Bermudez](), [J.F. Sebastian](http://stackoverflow.com/users/4279/j-f-sebastian), and [shaktimaan](), I probably would not have the program running right now.
You can see the individual questions where they completely overhauled my code until it was barely recognizable as mine [here](), [here](), and [here]().
