pages-pdf
=========

A simple python script that converts a .pages document into a PDF. GUI version, command-line version, and executables coming soon! (hopefully)

The Scripts
===========
Pages-zip.py is the working one, authored by me but tweaked extensively by [Stack Overflow user martineau](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22161088/how-to-extract-a-file-within-a-folder-within-a-zip-in-python).

Pages-zip old.py is the original, authored only by me, which doesn't work (because I couldn't make it work without martineau's help).

Have fun!
